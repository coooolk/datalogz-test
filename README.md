# SRE/DevOps Interview Exercise

This challenge is designed to assess your troubleshooting, debugging, and problem‚Äêsolving skills across both infrastructure-as-code and application layers.

## Objective

You are provided with three files:
- **Terraform Configuration:** This file provisions an AWS EC2 instance along with an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and related security groups.
- **Flask Application:** A simple web server running on the provisioned instance.
- **Python Connectivity Script:** A script that attempts to connect to the ALB endpoint.

**Note:** Currently, the Python connectivity script does not successfully connect to the ALB. Your task is to analyze both the configuration and the application code to identify what might be causing this connectivity failure, and then propose and explain your actions.

## Guidelines

- **Time Limit:** Aim to complete your review and propose corrective actions within 10 minutes.
- **Process:** As you work through the exercise, please explain your thought process out loud. We are very interested in how you approach troubleshooting and problem resolution.
- **Discussion:** Be prepared to walk us through your findings and recommendations during the discussion.

Good luck!
